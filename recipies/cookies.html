<h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        There are a few secrets to the best classic, chewy chocolate chip cookies. Number one: Don't use chips; instead, opt for a mix of milk or semisweet and dark chocolate chunks. The second is to let the dough rest overnight or longer for a more complex, toffee-like flavor. Lastly, use an ice cream scooper to get even-sized cookies every time. And that's it! With these little tweaks, the result is a cookie that's textured on the outside, and soft and gooey on the inside. Absolutely perfect!

<h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <p>Servings: 36 cookies</p>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup granulated sugar(100 g)
        </li>
        <li>¾ cup brown sugar(165 g), packed</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ cup unsalted butter(115 g), melted</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour(155 g)</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>4 oz milk or semi-sweet chocolate chunks(110 g)</li>
        <li>4 oz dark chocolate chunk(110 g), or your preference</li>
    </ul>

<h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the sugars, salt, and butter
        until a paste forms with no lumps.</li>
        <li>Whisk in the egg and vanilla, beating until light ribbons
        fall off the whisk and remain for a short while before falling
        back into the mixture.</li>
        <li>Sift in the flour and baking soda, then fold the mixture
        with a spatula (Be careful not to over-mix, which would cause
        the gluten in the flour to toughen resulting in cakier
        cookies).</li>
        <li>Fold in the chocolate chunks, then chill the dough for at least 30 minutes. For a more intense toffee-like flavor and deeper color, chill the dough overnight. The longer the dough rests, the more complex its flavor will be.
        </li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Line a baking sheet with
        parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Scoop the dough with an ice-cream scoop onto a parchment
        paper-lined baking sheet, leaving at least 4 inches (10 cm) of
        space between cookies and 2 inches (5 cm) of space from the
        edges of the pan so that the cookies can spread evenly.</li>
        <li>Bake for 8-10 minutes, or until the edges have started to
        barely brown.</li>
        <li>Cool completely before serving.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
